    "#### Analyzing the Analyzers Key Points\n",
    "1. “Data Science” is such a broad, if not vague term. It may mean different things to different people. Personally, I identify with Binita/Dmitri and did not really consider myself a “real” data scientist. My idea of a real one was similar to the description of Rebecca the Data Researcher.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. I find the work of the authors important (defining what Data Scientists do) as it helps organisations and data scientists come to a common understanding of work expectations. It really helps to identify what type or subset of work a Data Scientist will do, similar to how doctors can be called different titles depending on their specialisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A successful data scientist needs to have breadth and depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Even a really good data scientist cannot do everything. One needs to work with different people with overlapping skill sets to produce something that is useful to the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Experience is key in developing your skill set as a data scientist. You will become better with time, industry exposure, and proper mentoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Data Science Handbook Chapter Summary\n",
    "*Chapter 1 - DJ Patil*\n",
    "\n",
    "DJ Patil worked in research and consulting prior to joining the tech world. He co-coined the term \"Data Scientist\" and built one of the first premier data science teams. He was appointed as the first Chief Data Scientist of the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "He talks about taking risks when starting in the field of data science. There is no clear-cut definition of what data science is, or what a data scientist does. So, a good way to start is to prove that you can do or build *something*. Next comes the task of communicating or describing what you built to other people. I think this is where pedagogy comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another key point is that data science is a team sport. As good as someone may be, success in the field usually comes as a result of collaboration between people with different backgrounds and skillsets. Like a whole being greater than the sum of its parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, DJ gives his opinion on how to develop one's skills as a data scientist. He says we do not know for sure what works or what doesn't, but it is very important that you put in your hours. Learn new skills, work with other people, be around individuals who are the best in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last advise I like best: Work on simple things. Simple things become hard; hard things become intractable. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Chapter 2 - Hilary Mason*\n",
    "\n",
    "Hilary Mason is the founder of Fast Forward Labs, a machine intelligence learning company and is the Data Scientist in Residence at Accel. Previously, she was the Chief Scientist at bitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "She describes her day-to-day work at Accel: She helps companies in their portfolio navigate interesting or challenging data questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "She says data science is a rising trend. Few people are doing it, but it is clearly applicable to most domains and not just in tech.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next five years will see a lot of change. Understanding will be greater, things will be more defined, tooling (should) be better, and data science will be an integral part of daily work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hilary also talks about the importance of communication and storytelling. I see it as bridging the gap between tech and non-tech people to get a better understanding of the problem and the approach in solving it.\n",
    "\n",
    "She also thinks that startups are a good place to develop skills in data science. In this environment, it is easier to get your hands on good data sets and choose your own approach in analysing it. Otherwise, it is important that you work with and for people who you are comfortable with, and who understand what they want you to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "She also shared some guide questions when working on a data science project:\n",
    "1. What are you working on?\n",
    "2. How will you know when you're done?\n",
    "3. What does it impact?\n",
    "\n",
    "Having answers to these questions will ensure you're making good use of your time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, she talks about the importance of learning and playing on your strengths. For fresh graduates, smaller companies are better especially if you have a good mentor who can teach you the right skills. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data science work can be divided into three buckets: Stats, Code, Visualisation. For aspiring data scientists, it is a good idea to work on projects that highlight your strengths. Then, another project where you're worst at. This will help you grow and round up your skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, she encourages people to put up their work on GitHub, and just be persistent as they learn and develop their skills in data science.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Idea 1: NBA Season 2015-2016 Prediction\n",
    "*Overview*\n",
    "\n",
    "I am an avid NBA fan. Even though I'm not able to watch all games, I make sure to follow box scores on a daily basis. I like looking at numbers and statistics and am able to get an idea of a team's performance without having to watch the game as it happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "I play fantasy basketball, and it involves putting together a team from a pool of players and competing against other teams in terms of counting stats. For my course project, I am thinking of something similar-- I want to predict which NBA team will win the season based on its players' statistics, as well as the effects of these statistics on different team match-ups.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Data*\n",
    "\n",
    "The NBA publishes complete statistics on [www.nba.com/stats](www.nba.com/stats). The website [www.basketball-reference.com](www.basketball-reference.com) is also a good place to get the same data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Outcome*\n",
    "\n",
    "I want to predict which teams will make it to the playoffs, and which team will eventually win the championship. I will use the published season schedule and player/team statistics to make my prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Modelling Technique*\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm thinking Regression? Using player and team stats like offensive/defensive efficiency as features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Idea 2: Social Sentiments Analysis\n",
    "*Overview*\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm rehashing a proof-of-concept that we once did at my previous company. We created a social sentiments tool that analysed tweets from our client's Twitter handle and visualised the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, I'm looking at \"unsupervised\" learning by looking at tweets belonging to trending topics (globally, per region, per country).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Data*\n",
    "\n",
    "Public tweets, pulled using Twitter's API.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Outcome*\n",
    "\n",
    "I want to observe what makes tweets popular, and how they are received by the Twitterverse (positive or negative). I may look at top words that elicit retweets, or just see which topics are popular in specific parts of the world and maybe correlate it with real-time events.\n",

    "\n",
    "I want to consider a project that has a social impact. One thing I am considering is to look at global warming data and come up with an analysis of how good (or bad) we're doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Data*\n",
    "\n",
    "I did a quick search and saw a site that offers free data sets on climate data. The name of the site is [http://data.worldbank.org/climate-change](http://data.worldbank.org/climate-change).\n",

    "Linear regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "*Overview*\n",
    "\n",
    "Do a high-level analysis on what factors may be contributing to cancer on specific countries.\n",
    "It will be supervised learning since I will be picking the conditions that may be contributing to cancer.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Data*\n",
    "\n",
    "TBD. I'm looking for data sets that will show cancer cases in specific countries, as well as possible factors like pollution levels, types of food consumed, climate, etc.\n",

    "Show a correlation between different factors and cancer occurrences.\n",
