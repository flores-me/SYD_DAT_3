    "*Linear Regression*\n",
    "\n",
    "Wikipedia defines [Linear Regresssion (LR)](www.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression) as an \"approach for modeling the relationship between a scalar dependent variable *y* and one or more explanatory variables *X*.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply put, it is a means of predicting the value of something (let's call this something *y*) given the state of one or more related things (let's collectively call these related thing(s) *X*).\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a person's height at age 18, for instance (they say we stop growing at 18). Intuitively, a person's \"final height\" is influenced by a number of factors: Generally, males are taller than females. Genetics also plays a major role-- if both parents are tall or short then we tend to be the same. There can be more but for purposes of discussion I'll stop here.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, *y* is a person's height at age 18, while *X* are: (1) Gender (2) Height of father and (3) Height of mother.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do this prediction, LR needs a set of actual *y* values and their associated *X* values as input in order to build the prediction model. If I were to be part of this set, my entry would look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Height:* 171cm; *Gender:* Male; *Height of father:* 162cm; *Height of mother:* 150cm\n",
    "\n",
    "The set should contain a significant number of entries so an accurate model can be created. For our example, let's say that there are 99 more entries. \n",
    "\n",
    "For each record in the set, LR looks at the other 3 attributes and makes an assumption on how these 3 produce the height. This assumption is the prediction model. Think of it as a formula or rule of thumb for predicting the value of *y*. The 3 chosen attributes may or may not help in making a good prediction. LR has a way of \"rating\" how each of the attributes actually help making a prediction. This \"rating\" is called the *p-value*. The lower, the better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's pretend that given the set, LR came up with the assumption: \"If female, take the average of parents' heights and subtract 5cm. If male, take the average of parents' heights and add 15cm.\". Given this logic, the model can now make a prediction on a person's height given the gender, mother's height, and father's height of someone who was not part of the initial survey.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let this someone be my sister:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Height:* 152cm; *Gender:* Female; *Height of father:* 162cm; *Height of mother:* 150cm\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the model, her predicted height will be: ((162+150)/2) - 5 = 151cm. This is a pretty good prediction. The percentage of \"good\" predictions a certain model will make is called *R-squared* in statistics. This value is a number between 0 and 1. The higher, the better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basing from my sister's sample above, the chosen attributes and the model are fairly accurate. The *p-value* for all 3 must be small and the *R-squared* value must be high.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Small Multiple - Where Australia's immigrants were born (SBS) *\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm choosing the [Immigrant Map Project](http://small.mu/work/#/work/immigrants-birthplace-map/) for its simplicity. I find it very interesting being a recent immigrant myself. \n",
    "\n",
    "The map chart aims to show the top ethnicity of immigrant populations in suburbs and towns across Australia. The approach is straightforward-- each delineated suburb is labelled with the top immigrant population. They also added a nice touch of coloring that suburb in a dominant color from that country's flag (except for England, which is grey). Hovering your cursor over the suburb displays supplemental information in a tooltip: the top 3 immigrant populations and the total population count.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data presented by the graph is easily verifiable. I'm Filipino, and most of my friends and family live in the northwest as shown in the graph. I also see a lot of Filos in the southwest, where I stayed for a few months after arriving (Filipinos are the second top population here). I currently reside in the Ryde area, and again, the graph confirms what I've observed about the number of people with Chinese ethnicity living in the area.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would say that the map chart is excellent in its current form. If there is anything I would add, it would be a legend showing which colors belong to which country so it is still possible to interpret the map even while zoomed out.\n",

    "* Choosing Features *\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 classical methods for selecting predictors in a model. To summarise:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Forward Selection* -  You start with a null model (i.e. no predictors). You then add predictors one at a time until you satisfy a \"stopping rule\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Backward Selection* - You start with *all* predictors in the model. Observe the p-value of all variables and remove the variable with the highest p-value (i.e. least statistically). Repeat until you satisfy a \"stopping rule\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Mixed Selection* - This is similar to forward selection. You start with a null model and add predictors incrementally. However, at each step you evaluate the p-values and may opt to remove a predictor that falls outside a defined threshold. Repeat until you satisfy a \"stopping rule\".\n",
    "\n",
    "* For programming part, see cell below *\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Course Project\n",
    "\n",
    "* 1. Wireframe  - created initial sketch for dashboard ideas *\n",
    "\n",
    "* 2. Regression Techniques *\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression can be used to extrapolate team-level statistics based on the performance of individual players. The plan is to take the statistics of the top 6 or 7 players and come up with the expected team performance. The results of the past 3 seasons can be used as training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, a team's statistics is compared against other teams'. Logistic regression can then be used to predict a Win or Lose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these predictions, I plan on mapping out the projected W/L record of all teams during this season."
